# drivingsim
An unreal project to talk to the driving sim at WSU.

// Okay! I've got it working.
// Let's test it all!

Manually moving the xyz position.
X slides the platform forward and back (NOT touchy, had it to +-90 and it was only moderate movement.
Y slides the platform side to side (along a horizontal axis)
Z slides the platform up and down

Manually moving the xyz rotation.
x rotates around the vertical axis (touchy)
y rocks around a horizontal axis (back and forth)
z rocks around a vertical axis (side to side)



Adding Acceleration in m/s
X rocks the platform forward and back
Y rotates the platform side to side
Z does nothing.

Gravity 
x rocks the platform forward and back
Y rocks the platform side to side
Z (should probably stay at 9.81 (remember that Z is down, not up)

Angular velocity
X swivels the platform around the vertical access (is touchy! +-3 started pulling the cord taut.)
Y rocked the platform around the horizontal axis. (touchy!)
Z rockedthe platform around a forward axis. (touchy!)
